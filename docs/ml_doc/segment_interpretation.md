# Customer Segment Interpretation

## Overview
Customers were segmented into four distinct groups based on demographic,
usage, billing, and service adoption characteristics using K-Means clustering.

Each segment represents a meaningful customer persona with clear business
implications.

---

## Segment 0 – Premium Loyal Families

Highly committed, long-term customers with bundled services, two-year
contracts, and strong ecosystem adoption. These customers are low churn
risk and high lifetime value.

---

## Segment 1 – At-Risk Price-Sensitive Singles

Short-term, minimally engaged customers on month-to-month contracts with
limited service adoption. This segment exhibits strong churn risk signals
and requires proactive retention efforts.

---

## Segment 2 – High-Usage Power Users

Digitally savvy customers with high service usage and strong engagement.
They generate high revenue but may be sensitive to service quality or
pricing changes.

---

## Segment 3 – Traditional Stable Families

Stable customers with moderate engagement and conservative service usage.
They show strong loyalty but limited upsell adoption compared to premium
segments.

---

## Notes
Segment definitions are relative and based on current data distributions.
Interpretations should be periodically revisited as customer behavior evolves.

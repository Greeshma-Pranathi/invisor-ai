# Chatbot Limitations

## Overview
The Invisor.ai chatbot is designed to summarize and explain existing
machine learning outputs. It does not perform reasoning, retraining,
or analysis beyond the uploaded dataset.

## Limitations

### No Open-Ended Reasoning
The chatbot cannot answer causal, speculative, or advisory questions.
It only summarizes patterns already present in the data.

### No Model Training or Modification
The chatbot cannot retrain models, change configurations, or run
simulations. All models are pre-trained and fixed for the MVP.

### Dataset-Scoped Operation
The chatbot works only on the currently uploaded dataset and does not
compare across datasets or time periods.

## Design Intent
These limitations ensure clarity, reliability, and demo readiness while
preventing misleading or hallucinated responses.
